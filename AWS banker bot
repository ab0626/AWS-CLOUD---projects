# AWS Banker Chatbot Documentation


Welcome to the **AWS Banker Chatbot** project! This chatbot is designed to assist users with common banking inquiries using **Amazon Lex** for natural language processing and interaction.

## 📦 Project Overview
The **Banker Chatbot** uses Amazon Lex to process and respond to user queries. It handles basic intents like balance inquiries, transaction history, and account management while providing fallback handling for unrecognized inputs.

## 📚 Key Features
### 🎯 Define a Basic Intent
- **Intent Definition:** The chatbot is configured with a basic intent in Amazon Lex to control how it responds to user inputs.
- **Example Intents:**
   - CheckAccountBalance
   - ViewTransactionHistory
   - TransferFunds

### 📝 Create Lists of Utterances
- **Utterance Collection:** The chatbot uses a variety of sample utterances to map user inputs to different intents.
- **Examples:**
   - "What's my balance?"
   - "Show me my recent transactions."
   - "I want to transfer money."

### 🛠️ Handle Failures with FallbackIntent
- **Fallback Management:** The `FallbackIntent` is configured to handle unrecognized inputs gracefully.
- **Example Response:**
   - "I'm not sure I understand. Could you please rephrase that?"

### 🔁 Define Variations for Responses
- **Message Variations:** A `MessageGroup` is implemented to offer semi-random responses, making the bot more conversational.
- **Example Responses:**
   - "Sure! Your current balance is $1,000."
   - "You have $1,000 in your account."

### 🧪 Build and Test Your Bot
- **Testing:** The chatbot can be tested in both text and voice formats within the Amazon Lex console.
- **Test Scenarios:**
   - Correct intent recognition.
   - Fallback handling.
   - Response variation consistency.

## 🎯 Project Goals
- **Improve customer experience** with automated banking assistance.
- **Demonstrate NLP capabilities** using Amazon Lex.
- **Ensure conversational flow** with message variation and fallback handling.

## 📖 How to Deploy
1. **Create a Lex Bot:** Log into the AWS Console and create a new Amazon Lex bot.
2. **Define Intents and Utterances:** Configure the intents and provide sample utterances.
3. **Configure Responses:** Add message variations and fallback responses.
4. **Enable Testing:** Test in both voice and text modes.
5. **Integrate with Lambda (Optional):** For dynamic responses, you can link the bot with an AWS Lambda function.

## 🚀 Next Steps
- Expand the intent library for more advanced banking operations.
- Implement Lambda functions for dynamic data fetching.
- Improve security with IAM roles and data encryption.
